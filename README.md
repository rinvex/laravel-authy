## Usage

Usage is pretty easy and straightforward:

### Authy App

Get Authy app instance and interact with it:

```php
$authyApp = app('rinvex.authy.app');
$appStats = $authyApp->stats(); // Get app stats
$appDetails = $authyApp->details(); // Get app details
```

### Authy User

Get Authy user instance and interact with it:

```php
$authyUser = app('rinvex.authy.user');
$user = $authyUser->register('user@domain.com', '317-338-9302', '54'); // Register user
$userActivity = $authyUser->registerActivity($user->get('user')['id'], 'cookie_login', 'Test Data'); // Register user activity
$userStatus = $authyUser->status($user->get('user')['id']); // Get user status
$userDeleted = $authyUser->delete($user->get('user')['id']); // Delete user
```

### Authy Token

Get Authy token instance and interact with it:

```php
$authyToken = app('rinvex.authy.token');
$smsTokenSent = $authyToken->send($user->get('user')['id'], 'sms'); // Send SMS token
$callTokenStarted = $authyToken->send($user->get('user')['id'], 'call'); // Start automated call
$tokenVerified = $authyToken->verify(54321, $user->get('user')['id']); // Verify token
```

### Intuitive Responses

Work Intuitively with Authy responses:

```php
$body = $tokenVerified->body(); // Get all response body
$code = $tokenVerified->statusCode(); // Get response status code
$succeed = $tokenVerified->succeed(); // Check whether respose is a success
$failed = $tokenVerified->failed(); // Check whether respose is a failure
$message = $tokenVerified->message(); // Get response message
$item = $tokenVerified->get('item'); // Get response body item
$errors = $tokenVerified->errors(); // Get response errors
```

> **Note:** All authy requests return authy response, with a unified interface for your convenience, so you can interact with all responses the same way as above.


## Installation

1. Install the package via composer:
    ```shell
    composer require rinvex/laravel-authy
    ```

2. If you don't have the following lines already, add them to your `config/services.php` file, before the end of the array:

    ```php
    'authy' => [
        'secret' => env('AUTHY_SECRET'),
    ],
    ```

3. If you haven't already: Register an [Authy](https://www.authy.com) account -> Sign in -> Access [dashboard](https://dashboard.authy.com) -> Create new application -> Copy your API Secret key

4. If you don't have the following lines already, add them to your project's `.env` file, at the end:

    ```ini
    AUTHY_SECRET=AuthySecretKey
    ```

    > **Note:** make sure to replace `AuthySecretKey` with your key from the previous step.

5. Done! You can refer to [Usage](#usage) again.


## Upgrade

- **Upgrading To `v2.x` From `v1.x`**

  API implementation is 100% backward compatible, but sandbox API has been dropped since it's officially deprecated. Also note that PHP7 is now required. Lastly the config options has been changed from `services.authy.mode`, `services.authy.keys.production`, and `services.authy.keys.sandbox` to only one key `services.authy.secret` for ease of use and consistency, accordingly the environment variables `AUTHY_MODE`, `AUTHY_PRODUCTION_KEY`, and `AUTHY_SANDBOX_KEY` are replaced with only one environment variable `AUTHY_SECRET`.
